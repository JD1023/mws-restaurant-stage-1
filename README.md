#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

This project is part of the Udacity Frond End Developer Nanodegree. This is  **Stage One** of the **Restaurant Reviews** project.

### Specification

I was given most of the Source Code and had to make the website responsive for mobile view, available offline by writing a service worker and add ARIA accessibility to the app to enable the use of screen readers.

### How to run

1. Clone or download this repository then open up your terminal in the project root directory.

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000` to see the app working.

3. Alternatively you can view the site online by visiting this url: https://restaurantreviews1--jd1023.repl.co/
